/*
What index would you create to improve
the performance of the above query and why?
*/
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON Employee(salary);

/*
Why:
The index on salary would speed up the look-up for both the outer and inner queries which are based on the salary.
For both the inner and outer queries, operations are being performed based on the salary column.
Without the index, for each of these operations, the database would have to scan the entire table. 
With the index:
- The inner subquery can quickly identify the maximum salary without scanning every row.
- The outer query can efficiently filter out the employees having the maximum salary and then identify the second maximum salary.
